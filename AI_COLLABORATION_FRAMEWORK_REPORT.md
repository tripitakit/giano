#### 1. Basic Agent Setup

```python
from workflow_engine import create_workflow_engine
from synchronization import create_synchronization_system
from message_protocol import CollaborationProtocol

# Initialize Agent 1
agent1_engine = create_workflow_engine("agent1", "/tmp/collaboration")

```

#### 2. Creating a Collaborative Workflow

```python
# Agent 1 creates workflow
workflow = agent1_engine.create_workflow(
    name="Multi-Agent Data Processing",
    description="Collaborative data processing pipeline",
    execution_strategy=ExecutionStrategy.PIPELINE
)

# Add tasks with agent assignments
task1_id = agent1_engine.add_task_to_workflow(
    workflow=workflow,
    name="Data Collection",
    description="Collect and validate input data",
    function=data_collection_function,
    required_resources=["input_database", "validation_service"],
    assigned_agent="agent1"
)

task2_id = agent1_engine.add_task_to_workflow(
    workflow=workflow,
    name="Data Processing",
    description="Process collected data using ML algorithms",
    function=ml_processing_function,
    dependencies=[task1_id],
    required_resources=["ml_engine", "gpu_cluster"],
    assigned_agent="agent2"
)

task3_id = agent1_engine.add_task_to_workflow(

success = agent1_sync.resource_coordinator.request_lock(
    resource_id="shared_dataset.csv",
    priority=Priority.HIGH,
    timeout=300.0
)

if success:
    # Perform resource-dependent operations
    process_shared_dataset()

    # Release when done
    agent1_sync.resource_coordinator.release_lock("shared_dataset.csv")
else:
    print("Failed to acquire resource - potential deadlock avoided")
```

#### 4. Inter-Agent Communication

```python
# Agent 1 requests collaboration
collaboration_protocol = CollaborationProtocol("agent1", "/tmp/collaboration")

success = collaboration_protocol.request_collaboration(
    target_agent="agent2",
    task_description="Joint ML model training",
    additional_data={"model_type": "neural_network", "dataset_size": "large"}
)

# Agent 2 responds to collaboration request
agent2_protocol = CollaborationProtocol("agent2", "/tmp/collaboration")
agent2_protocol.grant_approval(
    target_agent="agent1",
    decision="approved",
    message="Ready for collaboration"
)
```

### Advanced Usage Patterns

#### 1. Multi-Phase Workflow Development

```python
# Phase 1: Design and Planning
design_workflow = create_design_phase_workflow(agents=["agent1", "agent2"])

# Phase 2: Implementation
impl_workflow = create_implementation_phase_workflow(
    dependencies=[design_workflow.workflow_id],
    agents=["agent1", "agent2", "agent3"]
)

# Phase 3: Testing and Validation
test_workflow = create_testing_phase_workflow(
    dependencies=[impl_workflow.workflow_id],
    agents=["agent2", "agent4"]  # QA specialists
)

# Submit all phases
for workflow in [design_workflow, impl_workflow, test_workflow]:
    engine.submit_workflow(workflow)
```

#### 2. Resource Pool Management

```python
# Define shared resource pools
resource_pools = {
    "compute_cluster": ["gpu_node_1", "gpu_node_2", "gpu_node_3"],
    "storage_systems": ["database_1", "cache_system", "file_storage"],
    "external_apis": ["ml_service", "data_service", "notification_service"]
}

# Agents coordinate resource allocation
for agent_id in ["agent1", "agent2", "agent3"]:
    coordinator = create_synchronization_system(agent_id, "/tmp/collaboration")
    coordinator.resource_coordinator.register_resource_pool(resource_pools)
```

#### 3. Monitoring and Health Checks

```python
# Monitor collaboration health
def monitor_collaboration_health():
    for agent_id in active_agents:
        coordinator = get_coordinator(agent_id)
        health = coordinator.health_check()

        if health["system_status"] != "healthy":
            handle_agent_health_issue(agent_id, health)

        # Check for deadlocks
        deadlocks = coordinator.resource_coordinator.deadlock_detector.detect_cycle()
        if deadlocks:
            resolve_deadlock_situation(deadlocks)

# Real-time monitoring
import threading
monitor_thread = threading.Thread(target=monitor_collaboration_health)
monitor_thread.daemon = True
monitor_thread.start()
```

### Production Deployment Guidelines

#### 1. Configuration Management

```python
# config.py
@dataclass
class ProductionConfig:
    communication_dir: str = "/var/collaboration/messages"
    max_agents: int = 10
    message_retention_days: int = 7
    deadlock_timeout_seconds: int = 30
    max_concurrent_workflows: int = 100
    security_encryption_enabled: bool = True
```

#### 2. Logging and Monitoring

```python
import logging

# Configure comprehensive logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('/var/log/collaboration.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)

# Monitor performance metrics
def log_performance_metrics():
    metrics = {
        "active_workflows": len(engine.scheduler.active_workflows),
        "resource_utilization": calculate_resource_utilization(),
        "message_throughput": calculate_message_throughput(),
        "collaboration_success_rate": calculate_success_rate()
    }
    logging.info(f"Performance metrics: {metrics}")
```

#### 3. Error Handling and Recovery

```python
# Implement robust error recovery
class CollaborationErrorHandler:
    def handle_agent_failure(self, failed_agent_id: str):
        # Redistribute failed agent's tasks
        # Release held resources
        # Notify other agents
        pass

    def handle_deadlock_recovery(self, deadlock_info):
        # Apply resolution strategy
        # Restart affected workflows
        # Update monitoring systems
        pass

    def handle_communication_failure(self, communication_error):
        # Retry message delivery
        # Switch to backup communication channels
        # Log incidents for analysis
        pass
```

        "feedback_format": "detailed_with_examples"
    }
}
```

#### 3. Quality Assurance Integration

```python

class ContinuousQualityMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.quality_thresholds = {
            "code_quality": 4.0,
            "test_coverage": 0.85,
            "performance": 4.0,
            "security": 4.5
        }

    def evaluate_collaboration_quality(self, collaboration_session):
        metrics = self.collect_quality_metrics(collaboration_session)

        for metric, threshold in self.quality_thresholds.items():
            if metrics[metric] < threshold:
                self.trigger_quality_improvement_process(metric, metrics[metric])
