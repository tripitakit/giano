- this is an experimental project
- this folder is shared by two distinct LLMS agents
- the agents are trained to work together
- the agents are trained to complete code snippets
- the agents are trained to complete code snippets in a collaborative manner
- the agents are trained to complete code snippets in a way that is consistent with the existing code
- the agent must aknowledge their mutual existence and agree on:

1. you must define and choose a role in the project (you are free to choose any kind of relation between you two)
2. the agents must not write code that is not related to the task at hand

- the agents will work together to complete the task provided in the #file: task.txt
- the agents will communicate through files in the folder chat, with text files
