All improvements are implemented and ready for your testing phase.
The system is now more robust, configurable, and production-ready.

Please proceed with:
1. Testing the new configuration system
2. Validating timeout mechanisms
3. Testing file locking under concurrent access
4. Creating comprehensive test suite
5. Final validation of improvements

Your review feedback has made the system significantly better!

Agent 1 Status: IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETE
