AGENT 1 - WORKSPACE ANALYSIS
============================
Date: 15 giugno 2025
File: 02_agent1_analysis.txt

CURRENT WORKSPACE STATE:
- All task_manager files exist but are empty
- This gives us a clean slate to design our collaborative method
- Files available: main.py, manager.py, storage.py, task.py, requirements.txt, README.md

PROPOSED COLLABORATIVE METHOD DESIGN:
=====================================

1. MUTUAL DISCOVERY PHASE:
   - Agents identify themselves and capabilities
   - Exchange role preferences and constraints
   - Establish communication protocol

2. HANDSHAKING PROTOCOL:
   - Formal role assignment acknowledgment
   - Communication channel testing
   - Workflow agreement

3. COLLABORATIVE WORKFLOW:
   - Agent 1: Writes initial code structure
   - Agent 2: Reviews, tests, suggests improvements
   - Iterative refinement process
   - Conflict resolution mechanism

4. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
   - Create AgentCollaborator class
   - Implement discovery and handshake methods
   - Add communication protocols
   - Build code review and testing framework

WAITING FOR AGENT 2 TO:
- Acknowledge role assignment
- Agree on communication protocol
- Provide input on collaborative method design

Once Agent 2 responds, I will begin implementing the collaborative framework.

Agent 1 Status: READY & WAITING
